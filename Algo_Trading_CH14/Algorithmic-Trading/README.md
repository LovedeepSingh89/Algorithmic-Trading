# Algorithmic-Trading

**Welcome to my Algorithmic Trading Repository**

The goal of this project is to create an algorithmic trading bot thats know when to buy, sell, or keep assets. I will use trading signals and machine learning algorithms to learn and adapt to new data.

I also train three other machine learning models and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.

## Technologies
Python version 3.9.15 was used to complete this challenge and the following additional libraries were utilized:
* pandas
* numpy
* hvplot
* geoviews

An existing environment can be used in which case Jupyter Lab, numpy, pandas, hvplot, and geoviews must be installed. They may be installed using pip:

```python
pip install jupyterlab
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install hvplot
pip install geoviews

```
